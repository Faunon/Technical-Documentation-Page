            <p>There’s an invisible risk when building a computer that threatens even the most powerful system: Static electricity. The
            same force that lets you shock your friends when you wear wool socks can also fry components in a heartbeat.
            Fortunately, static is easy to all but eliminate with a few simple steps.</p>
            <p>One simple solution is to purchase an antistatic wristband. One end wraps around your wrist, and the other clips
            somewhere on the computer case, keeping the wearer constantly grounded. Touching the case frequently with the PSU
            plugged in and powered off achieves the same effect.</p> 
            <p>Make sure you're building your PC in a room with a bare floor if you can — carpets generate a lot of static — and wear
            rubber-soled shoes rather than socks. Many components ship in antistatic bags, so leave them bagged until just before
            installation.</p>

            <header>Opening the Case</header>
            <p>Preparing the case is the easy part. Instructions for the specific case you purchased should introduce you to its basic
            layout, as well as list special instructions regarding component installation.</p>
            <p>Lay down the case in your work area and remove the side panel. For most PC cases, this means the left-side panel when
            viewed from the front. This panel provides access to the case interior.</p>
            <p>Also, remove anything that’s dangling inside the case. If it’s attached, push it aside. Many cases have permanent
            internal wiring that becomes problematic later on.</p>
            <p>Before we start putting everything together, we’ll first install the power supply and then set the case aside for a few
            minutes.</p>

            <header>How to Install the Power Supply</header>
            <p>The first component to make its way into the case should be the power supply (PSU). It is typically located at the rear
            of the case, usually in the bottom or top corner. Consult your case’s manual if you have trouble finding the proper
            location.</p>
            <h4>Step 1:</h4><p>Place your power supply in the mounting position. Most cases are designed for the PSU to be installed with the
            fan facing down, letting it pull cool air from outside the case, but check your manual if you're unsure.</p>

            <h4>Step 2:</h4><p>Attach it to your case using appropriate screws, or thumb screws.</p>

            <h4>Step 3:</h4><p>If your power supply is a modular PSU, plug in the power cables that you need for your various components. If
            you're not sure, though, don't worry, you can plug them in later as and when needed. If your PSU is not modular, you'll
            have all the cables already installed.</p>

        <section class="main-section" id="How_to_Install_the_Processor">
            <header>How to Install the Processor</header>
            <p>Although you don't have to, it's a good idea to install the processor before you put the motherboard in the case, as
            access is far easier.</p>
            <h4>Step 1:</h4><p>Carefully remove the motherboard from its antistatic bag and set it on a hard, flat, nonmetal surface such as a
            wooden desk, or the top of the motherboard box itself. Also, make sure there are no sources of dust or liquid nearby.
            Even though installing a CPU is an easier task now than it was in previous years, it’s still precarious. There are
            numerous pins on the CPU and/or motherboard, and bending any one of them could render that component kaput.</p>
            <p>The process isn’t designed to be difficult, and as long as you follow the instructions clearly and keep an eye out to
            ensure the chip is fully seated before you clamp it in place, you’ll be fine. However, there are some subtle differences
            in the process depending on who made your CPU.</p>
            <img src="https://www.digitaltrends.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/pcbuildcpu01.jpg?fit=720%2C720&p=1" class="cpu" alt="installing-cpu">    
            <h4>Step 2:</h4><p>Although the design of Intel and AMD CPUs are a little different, the process for installing them is much the
            same, no matter which kind of processor and motherboard you have. Intel CPUs have flat metal contacts on the underside,
            and the pins reside inside the socket, whereas AMD CPUs have pins on the underside of the processor, and contacts in the
            socket. In either case, do not bend or touch the pins.</p>
            <p>The square metal bracket holding the CPU in place is the load plate, and it’s raised and lowered using the load lever.
            When clamped down, the end of the load lever tucks under a hook to keep everything in place. When you unbox your
            motherboard, the contact array will be covered with a piece of plastic. This plastic will pop out once you open the
            bracket, so wait to open it until you’re ready to install your processor.</p>
            <p>First, open the load plate. Do this by gently pushing down on the load arm and moving it out sideways from under the
            hook, and then raising it up all the way. The hook’s lever action opens the plate, which you can easily flip up. At this
            point, the plastic piece will come loose. If it doesn’t pop out, gently remove it.</p>
            <h4>Step 3:</h4><p>To install the CPU, you need to line it up correctly. On most Intel CPUs, you'll have notches on the side that
            allow you to only place the CPU in one orientation. On the latest 12th-generation Intel CPUs, you get a little golden
            triangle in one corner to help you align it properly. The same is true of all modern AMD processors.</p>
            <p>Pick the processor up by its sides and align it correctly using whatever aids you're given, and gently place it into the
            CPU socket. Double-check alignment, and give the processor a little nudge to make sure that it has slotted in correctly.
            If in doubt, remove it and try again just to be sure.</p>

            <h4>Step 4:</h4><p>Once you're happy that the CPU is correctly installed, press the retaining arm down firmly, but gently, until
            the CPU is locked in place. This can take quite a bit of pressure, but it shouldn't be hard. If in doubt, check again
            that the CPU was seated correctly before locking it down.</p>

        <section class="main-section" id="How_to_Install_RAM">
            <header>How to Install RAM</header>
            <p>System memory, or RAM, doesn’t require any careful goo placement or wires. There are just two important factors,
            assuming you’ve chosen compatible RAM: Direction and slot choice.</p>
            <p>The direction is easy enough. Each memory stick has a notch in the contacts lining the bottom edge that lines up with a
            block in the motherboard’s memory slots. If you hold it just above the slot and the two line up, it’s facing the right
            direction. If it doesn’t line up, spin it 180 degrees.</p>
            <p>Slot choice depends on a few factors, one of which is how you purchased RAM. If you have just a single stick of RAM, you
            want to install it in the first slot, often called A1. If you have two sticks, you'll often want to install them in the
            A2 and B2 slots, but check your motherboard's manual for confirmation of where they should go.</p>
            <h4>Step 1:</h4><p>When you know which slot to install your RAM in, push the plastic wings at either end of the slot down and
            outward (some motherboards only have one), then place the stick in the slot sticking straight up. Push down firmly until
            the RAM clicks into the slot, and the plastic wings click back in and clamp the ends of the sticks.</p>
            <p>Be sure that your motherboard is well supported across its entire surface, as it is possible to put too much pressure on
            the motherboard when installing RAM if you push too hard. This is unlikely, but as with any steps in this guide, take
            care, and if in doubt, double-check everything before proceeding.</p>

            <h4>Step 2:</h4><p>Repeat the same process for each stick you have until all of your RAM is installed.</p>

        <section class="main-section" id="How_to_Install_the_Motherboard">
            <header>How to Install the Motherboard</header>
            <p>The motherboard is the most unweildy component in your system, but since it acts as the foundation for everything else
            in your case, installing it correctly is of paramount importance.</p>
            <h4>Step 1:</h4><p>Take your motherboard's rear I/O panel from the box — it looks like a small cutout of all the different
            motherboard ports — and install it in the back of your case by orientating it properly, and pushing it in. Double-check
            that it aligns with your motherboard's outputs before plugging it in if you're not sure which way it goes.</p>
            <h4>Step 2:</h4><p>To install the motherboard, you have to screw it into the insulating standoffs that prevent your components from
            shorting. Some cases come with these preinstalled, while others need you to install them yourself. They’re easy to
            identify because they look unusual — essentially screws that have another screw hole on top instead of the typical
            screwdriver notch. They’re usually gold or black.</p>
            <p>If necessary, screw in your motherboard's standoffs into the correct holes depending on the size and layout of your
            motherboard. You can look at your motherboard to figure it out, or install them where your manual suggests.</p>
            <h4>Step 3:</h4><p>Place your motherboard into your case, and push and wiggle it into place so that it slots into your I/O panel
            and has all of its screw holes lined up with the motherboard standoffs underneath.</p>
            <p>To attach your motherboard to the case, screw it in. First, seat the screws and give them a couple of precursory turns.
            Then, proceed in a star pattern, tightening each screw a little at a time. Don’t go wild while tightening as you might
            damage the board. You only need enough torque to hold the board in place without it wiggling.</p>

            <h4>Step 4:</h4><p>Once the motherboard is seated comfortably in the case, there are a few necessary connections.</p>
            <p>The motherboard’s main power connection is a wide, two-row cable that fits snugly into a similar-looking spot on the
            board itself. This 20-28 pin connector powers both the motherboard and the CPU. However, some boards have a second 4-pin
            or 8-pin connector for the processor, which resides near your CPU, typically in the top corner. If you have it, you’ll
            need to plug that in, too.</p>
            <p>Connect the case plugs and buttons to the motherboard. A double-wide row of pins — the location of which will be noted
            in your manual — runs the USB ports, buttons for reset and power, and activity LEDs for power and storage.</p>
            <p>These small cables run in a bundle from wherever the ports reside in the case. Proper installation can be difficult,
            however, due to their size. If you have a magnifying glass or a set of tweezers, now is a great time to use them. Some
            motherboards include an adapter that bridges these jumpers to the right connections on your motherboard. Otherwise,
            installing them is as simple as matching the labels on the pins with the labels on the connections.</p>
            <p>The USB header connecting to your front-facing motherboard ports will be on its own. This connection is around eight by
            two pins, and they’re enclosed in a larger plastic housing. This header has a notch on one side that should clearly
            indicate which direction it plugs in.</p>

        <section class="main-section" id="How_to_Install_the_CPU_Cooler">
            <header>How to Install the CPU Cooler</header>
            <p>Installing a CPU cooler differs depending on the cooler you're using, so for specific instructions, please refer to the
            manufacturer's manual or support site. Here are some simple instructions that apply to almost every cooler.</p>
            <h4>Note:</h4><p>In the below images, we're installing an all-in-one (AIO) watercooler, but the tips apply to most air coolers as
            well.</p>
            <h4>Step 1:</h4><p>Every cooler needs thermal paste. You don't have to use the best thermal paste, but make sure you use some. It
            typically looks like a silver paste and comes either preapplied to the cooler, or in a short syringe tube.</p>
            <p>If you're reapplying heat paste, be sure to remove the original heat paste with a lint-free cloth and a little isopropyl
            alcohol.</p>
            <p>When your CPU is ready, Apply a pea-sized amount to your CPU in the center.</p>
            <img src="https://www.digitaltrends.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/pcbuildcpu04.jpg?fit=720%2C720&p=1" class="cpu-cooler1" alt="installing-cpu-cooler">
            <h4>Step 2:</h4><p>If your CPU cooler requires it, remove your case's other side panel and attach the custom backplate design. You
            may need to remove the stock backplate from the motherboard first.</p>
            <h4>Step 3:</h4><p>Place the CPU cooler on top of the processor, and press down gently. Line up any retaining brackets or bolts
            with the CPU cooler mounting holes on the motherboard.</p>
            <p>Install the retaining screws/brackets to secure the cooler in place. If you have to tighten several screws, be sure to
            do them a couple of turns at a time in a cross pattern, so that you don't put too much pressure on one portion of the
            CPU. Make sure that they are tight enough that the CPU cannot wiggle around, but don't overtighten.</p>

            <h4>Step 4:</h4><p>If your cooler has a separate fan, attach it now, and plug its 3pin or 4pin connector into the CPU cooler port
            on the motherboard. It should be located near the CPU cooler.</p>
            <p>If you're installing an AIO watercooler, mount the radiator at an appropriate point in the case (at the front or rear
            air intakes/exhaust are common) and attach the fan's header to the correct port.</p>

            <header>How to Install the Graphics Card</header>
            <p>Not every system needs a dedicated graphics card (discrete GPU), but for most gaming PCs, it's a necessity.</p>
            <h4>Step 1:</h4><p>Modern graphics cards use a PCI-Express (PCIe) x16 slot. It’s a long, thin connector located on the rear of the
            motherboard, below the processor. For the vast majority of motherboards, you’ll want to use the top PCIe x16 slot.</p>
            <p>To seat the card in that slot, you’ll need to remove one, two, or, in some cases, three rectangular backplates from your
            case. It’s one of many thin metal brackets lined down the back of the case to keep it sealed up. Do this by removing the
            screw(s) that secures the backplate(s) to the chassis. Once removed, the plate should slide (or fall) out freely.</p>
            <p>Keep the screw, as you’ll need it in a moment.</p>
            <h4>Step 2:</h4><p>Grab your graphics card and, making sure the ports are aligned to the rear of the case and the PCIExpress
            connector is facing down, carefully slot it into the motherboard. You should hear a click when the motherboard locks it
            into place, but that's not always the case on every motherboard.</p>
            <p>You don’t need excessive force, so if you encounter a great deal of resistance, take another look at the backplate and
            PCIe slot to make sure both are clear and the motherboard is properly aligned. Also take note if there is a pushpin that
            locks the card in like your memory slots, as some motherboards use it as a safety measure.</p>

            <h4>Step 3:</h4><p>Use the screws pulled from the metal brackets to fasten the back of the card into the same spot in the case.
            Again, they don’t need to be extremely tight — just enough to hold the card firmly in place.</p>

            <h4>Step 4:</h4><p>Most graphics cards need more power than the PCIe slot provides. If your card needs extra juice, you’ll see one
            or two PCIe power connectors on the card’s side facing away from the motherboard or, in some cases, on the top of the
            card. This can be a traditional six- or eight-pin PCIe power connector, or a new mini-12pin.</p>
            <p>Find the appropriate connector on your power supply, sometimes labeled VGA, and slot it in. The connector’s design
            prevents improper installation, so if the connection isn’t easy, double-check your alignment to make sure it’s correct.</p>

            <header>How to Install Expansion Cards</header>
            <p>Graphics cards aren’t the only components that use PCIe slots. Other add-in cards include wireless networking, sound,
            video capture, and even storage. Their installation is no different than adding a discrete GPU.</p>
            <p>There are a few different types of PCIe slots. Many expansion cards use the “PCIe 4x” slot, which is much shorter than
            the full PCIe slot used by video cards. A quick check of your motherboard’s connectivity, and the size of the connector
            on your card, will make it obvious which slot is appropriate. If in doubt, refer to the expansion card’s manual.</p>
            <h4>Step 1:</h4><p>Remove the metal bracket at the back of the case that corresponds with the PCIe or other expansion slot playing
            host to your add-in card. Keep the bracket screw handy so you can use it to secure your new card.</p>
            <h4>Step 2:</h4><p>Line up the row of contacts on the card with the slot and firmly push down. If the card requires any additional
            power from SATA or 4pin molex connectors, find the right cables and plug them into the card.</p>
            <h4>Step 3:</h4><p>Secure the card in place by screwing it into the back of the case.</p>

        <section class="main-section" id="How_to_Install_Hard_Drives_and_SSDs">
            <header>How to Install Hard Drives and SSDs</header>
            <p>There are three different storage drive sizes you’re likely to encounter, and they all mount and connect differently.
            Generally, hard disk drives (HDD) are the larger 3.5-inch size, while newer solid-state drives (SSD) adopt the smaller
            2.5-inch size. There’s also the even smaller M.2 format and PCI-Express drive format, which tend to be thin sticks with
            bare chips measuring around a few inches long.</p>
            <h4>Step 1:</h4><p>To install a hard drive, find the 3.5-inch drive mounting point(s) in your case. These can be full hard drive
            cages with multiple mounting points, or it might be just space for a single drive with screw holes right in the case. If
            in doubt, refer to your manual.</p>
            <p>Slot your drive into the appropriate place and screw, or lock it into place using your case's mounting system. When in
            place, attach the SATA data cable to the drive and the motherboard, and attach the SATA power connector to the drive.</p>

            <h4>Step 2:</h4><p>To install a SATA SSD, repeat the same steps as the larger hard drive, only change the mounting point to an
            appropriate 2.5-inch cage or slot. Make sure that it is secured in place, and attach both the SATA power and data cable.</p>
            <img src="https://www.digitaltrends.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/pcbuildstorage02.jpg?fit=700%2C467&p=1" class="hd-ssd1" alt="">

            <h4>Step 3:</h4><p>To install an M.2 NVMe SSD, locate the appropriate slot on your motherboard. It will be labeled, but it is
            pretty small, so check your manual if you're unsure.</p>
            <p>Remove the retaining screw and slot the drive in at a 45-degree angle. Gently, but firmly push down on the drive until
            it clicks into place, then replace the retaining screw.</p>
            <h4>Step 4:</h4><p>To install a PCIe SSD, choose an appropriate PCIe slot on your motherboard. The 16x slots will offer the most
            bandwidth, but that may not be necessary for your particular drive's bandwidth. Consult the drive's manual for
            confirmation on which is best for your particular motherboard.</p>
            <p>Angle the drive with the gold contacts down, then gently push it into the PCIe slot. It should click into place when it
            is locked in. It shouldn't take much force, so if it gets stuck, check the alignment.</p>
            <p>Attach any necessary additional power cables.</p>

            <header>Double check Everything</header>
            <p>With everything installed, it's worth checking everything once more before you hit that power button. It can prevent any
            heart-stopping moments where you get warning beeps because you forgot a power cable.</p>
            <h4>Step 1:</h4><p>The motherboard should be seated correctly and doesn't move if you jostle it a little. It should also have the
            20+4 pin power connector plugged into the relevant slot and be firmly seated. There may be an additional 4pin or 8pin
            connector at the top of the board that also needs to be plugged in.</p>
            <h4>Step 2:</h4><p>The CPU cooler needs to be fitted securely to the processor, and the fan needs power. Make sure the fan's 3pin
            or 4pin connector is plugged into the appropriate slot on the motherboard.</p>
            <h4>Step 3:</h4><p>If you have a graphics card, make sure it's plugged into the board correctly and has any appropriate power
            cables attached. Some cards, like the RTX 3080, even require two eight-pin connections, or their own special mini-12pin.
            These plugs are brightly colored and easy to spot and only fit in the interior end of the card in one orientation. If
            they aren’t plugged in, the fans on the card won’t spin, and it won’t produce any video output.</p>
            <h4>Step 4:</h4><p>Make sure any expansion cards are also mounted into their PCIe slot comfortably, and have any relevant power
            cables plugged in.</p>
            <h4>Step 5:</h4><p>Make sure each hard drive and SSD is installed correctly and won't come loose when you pick the case up or move
            it. Ensure they each have the relevant power and data cables plugged in, too.</p>

            <header>Turn the PC on</header>
            <h4>Step 1:</h4><p>Switch on the power supply and press the power button on the front. If all is well, it should display the post
            screen or manufacturer logo on the monitor, and then move on to Windows installation, or the login screen. If it
            doesn't, however, don't fret. It's not uncommon for PCs to need to reboot a couple of times on their first startup.</p>
            <p>If you encounter any error messages or beeps, refer to your motherboard's manual to decode the message and figure out
            what you need to fix.</p>
            <p>If you don't get any power at all, turn the power supply off and double-check all of your connections. Make sure the
            wall socket is turned on, too.</p>
            <h4>Step 2:</h4><p>Once the system does boot up, you'll need to install Windows.</p>
            <h4>Step 3:</h4><p>Once you reach Windows, you'll need to install drivers. Windows 10 already supports modern chipsets and
            automatically downloads and installs the remaining drivers in most cases. Check the Update & Security menu in the
            Settings pane for more information regarding this process.</p>
            <p>If that doesn’t work, the chipset driver for your motherboard will handle most connectivity and onboard features, though
            this varies greatly based on motherboard and component manufacturers. You can download the latest version(s) from your
            motherboard manufacturer's website.</p>
            <p>If you have a discrete graphics card, you’ll periodically have to check for updates and install them when they come
            available.</p>
            <p>With some luck and a lot of attention to detail, you should have a fully operational system. Keep an eye on your system
            temperatures for a few days to make sure all the coolers are working correctly, and if an error message pops up, take
            care of it accordingly. After a few weeks, you’ll get the hang of your machine and be more confident in what you can
            push it to do.</p>
            <p>If something breaks or needs an upgrade, you’re fully equipped to deal with it.</p>
